### Andrew Patterson

I am a (combination of): 

- solution architect
- full stack developer
- cloud engineer
- team lead

I happen to have lots of experience in the world of health IT - genomics, medical terminology
and primary care data analytics - but am interested in any field that is interesting.

Iâ€™m currently working on:
- federated data sharing for genomics in Australia ( see [Elsa Data](https://github.com/elsa-data) ).

I have previously:
- solution architect and lead developer for genomics platform [Genomical](https://genomical.com.au)
- designed and developed the initial commercial release of an award winning clinical data analytics tools [PenCS CAT](https://www.pencs.com.au/products/cat/)
- was a core member of the team developing the student Java IDE [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org)

I am apparently the only developer in the world *not* experimenting or working with AI.
