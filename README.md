### Roles

| Full stack developer | Solution architect | Cloud engineer | Team lead |
| :--- |  :--- |  :--- |  :--- |
| 30 years (includes "desktop" era!) | 20 years | 5 years | 5 years |

I happen to have had many roles in the world of health IT - genomics, medical terminology
and primary care data analytics - but am interested in any field that is interesting.

### Experience

I‚Äôm currently working on:
- federated data sharing for genomics in Australia ( see [Elsa Data](https://github.com/elsa-data) ).

I previously:
- have been a solution architect and lead developer for a genomics platform [Genomical](https://genomical.com.au)
- designed and developed the initial commercial release of an award winning clinical data analytics tool [PenCS CAT](https://www.pencs.com.au/products/cat)
- was a core member of the team developing the Java IDE for students [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org)

I am apparently the only developer in the world *not* experimenting or working with AI.
