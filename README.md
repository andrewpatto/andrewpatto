### Andrew Patterson

I am a (combination of): 

- solution architect
- full stack developer
- cloud engineer
- team lead

I happen to have lots of experience in the world of health IT - genomics, medical terminology
and primary care data analytics - but am interested in any field that is interesting.

I am apparently the only developer in the world *not* experimenting or working with AI.

Iâ€™m currently working on federated data sharing for genomics in Australia ( see [Elsa Data](/elsa-data) ).
